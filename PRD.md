## 1. Executive Summary

Brand Inspector is a Chrome extension that enables marketing teams, designers, and agencies to capture and analyze brand assets directly from websites. The extension bridges the gap between visual brand discovery and systematic brand profile creation, integrating with our existing web application to provide a seamless workflow for brand asset management.
