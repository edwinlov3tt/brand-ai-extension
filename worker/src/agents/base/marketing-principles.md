## Core Marketing Principles

1. **Clarity over Cleverness**: Clear communication always beats clever wordplay
2. **Benefits before Features**: Lead with transformation, support with specs
3. **Specificity Builds Trust**: "Increase leads by 40%" > "Get more leads"
4. **Urgency without Pressure**: Create FOMO naturally, not artificially
5. **Social Proof Integration**: Weave in proof points authentically
6. **Emotional then Logical**: Hook with emotion, close with logic
7. **Accessibility First**: All content must work for all abilities

## Mandatory Grammar & Style Rules

### Sentence Structure
- **Maximum 19 words per sentence** - Break longer sentences into two
- **Transition words:** Use naturally when connecting ideas. Long-form (blog, landing page) may use 20-30%. Short-form ads: use sparingly (natural connectors: and, but, so, because)
- **Less than 9% passive voice** - Use active voice 91%+ of the time
- Vary sentence length for rhythm (mix short punchy with medium)

### Transition Words (Use Frequently)
- however, moreover, in addition, therefore, furthermore
- consequently, meanwhile, subsequently, nevertheless, thus
- for example, in fact, as a result, on the other hand
- specifically, importantly, notably, essentially

### Paragraph Rules
- **One idea per paragraph** - Stay focused, no topic drift
- New subheading every 300 words maximum
- Lead with the most important information (inverted pyramid)

### CRITICAL: Punctuation Rules

**NEVER USE:**
- Em dashes (—) - Use commas, periods, or colons instead
- En dashes (–) for emphasis - Use commas or restructure
- Semicolons for casual content - Break into separate sentences
- Ellipsis (...) unless indicating trailing off in dialogue

**ALWAYS USE:**
- Commas for natural pauses
- Periods for clear sentence endings
- Colons to introduce lists or explanations
- Hyphens only for compound adjectives (e.g., "well-known brand")

### Dangling Modifiers - AVOID AT ALL COSTS

A dangling modifier is a word or phrase that modifies something not clearly stated in the sentence.

**WRONG (Dangling):**
- "Walking to the store, the rain started falling." (Who is walking?)
- "After reviewing the data, the decision was made." (Who reviewed?)
- "To improve sales, marketing strategies were implemented." (Who wants to improve?)

**CORRECT:**
- "Walking to the store, I noticed the rain starting to fall."
- "After reviewing the data, the team made the decision."
- "To improve sales, we implemented new marketing strategies."

**The Rule:** The subject immediately following an introductory phrase MUST be the one performing the action in that phrase.

### Active vs Passive Voice

**PASSIVE (Avoid):**
- "The project was completed by our team."
- "Your home will be transformed by our experts."
- "Results were achieved through hard work."

**ACTIVE (Preferred):**
- "Our team completed the project."
- "Our experts will transform your home."
- "Hard work achieved these results."

### Contractions & Natural Language
Use contractions to sound human:
- we're, don't, can't, won't, you'll, they're, it's
- Avoid: cannot, will not, do not (unless emphasizing)

### Words to Avoid
- "Very" - Use stronger words instead
- "Really" - Often unnecessary
- "Just" - Weakens statements
- "Actually" - Implies surprise, often condescending
- "Literally" - Usually misused
- "Basically" - Oversimplifies
- "In order to" - Just use "to"
- "Due to the fact that" - Just use "because"

<question_policy>

## Question Usage Policy

### Question Budget (Channel-Dependent)
- **Landing pages:** 0-1 questions per section (no question headings by default)
- **Google Search RSA:** 0-1 only when mirroring search intent
- **Meta Feed/Reels:** 0-1 pattern interrupts only
- **Email subjects:** 0-1 if it mirrors user thought
- **Display/YouTube:** 0 (visual does the interrupt)
- **SMS:** 0 (feels spammy)

### Question Rubric
A question is ONLY allowed if ALL 5 criteria pass:

1. **Intent-mirroring** - Mirrors a real user thought, not a marketing prompt
2. **Specific** - Mentions concrete situation, outcome, or constraint
3. **Short** - Ideally 3-8 words, can stand alone
4. **Not banned** - Avoids all banned templates (below)
5. **Immediately answered** - Next sentence answers it directly

If ANY criterion fails: Rewrite as a direct statement hook.

### Banned Question Templates
NEVER use these (or close variants):
- "Why choose us?"
- "Still thinking about...?" / "Still putting off...?"
- "What are you waiting for?"
- "Ready to...?" / "Are you ready to...?"
- "Looking for...?" (only allowed in Search if mirroring keyword)
- "Here's your sign..."
- "Dream X is calling..."

### Good vs Bad Questions

**Bad (Meta/Rhetorical):**
- "Why choose us?" → Rewrite: "No runaround. Clear pricing."
- "Ready to transform your kitchen?" → Rewrite: "Your kitchen, finished by spring."

**Good (Scene/Specific):**
- "Hate surprise costs?" → "You'll get a line-item estimate before work starts."
- "Outdated cabinets?" → "Gone by spring. $1,000 off before Jan 1."

### Pre-Output Question Check
Before finalizing, scan for banned patterns. If found:
1. Check against Question Rubric
2. If fails any criterion, rewrite as statement hook
3. Prefer: direct benefit, proof point, micro-story, or vivid snapshot
