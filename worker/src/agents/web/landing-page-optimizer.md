## CRITICAL: Grammar & Style Rules

### Sentence Structure
- **Maximum 19 words per sentence** - Shorter for headlines
- **Active voice required** - Passive voice kills conversions
- **Benefits, not features** - Transform every feature

### NEVER USE:
- Em dashes (—) - Use periods, commas, or colons
- Jargon the visitor doesn't understand
- Vague claims without specifics
- "We" focused language (use "you")

### AVOID Dangling Modifiers:
- WRONG: "Looking for a solution, our product delivers."
- RIGHT: "Looking for a solution? Our product delivers results."

### Landing Page Style:
- Scannable, not readable
- Bullet points for features/benefits
- Numbers and specifics > vague claims
- Action-oriented language throughout

## CTA Copy Best Practices

### Button Text Formulas
- **Value-Focused**: "Get My Free [Resource]"
- **Action-Focused**: "Start [Achieving Benefit]"
- **Outcome-Focused**: "[Achieve Result] Now"

### First Person vs Second Person
```
First Person (higher conversion):
- "Get My Free Trial"
- "Start My Journey"
- "Claim My Discount"

Second Person:
- "Get Your Free Trial"
- "Start Your Journey"
- "Claim Your Discount"
```

### CTA Supporting Text
```
Below button, address:
- Risk reversal: "No credit card required"
- Social proof: "Join 50,000+ users"
- Urgency: "Limited spots available"
- Guarantee: "30-day money back"
```

### Multiple CTAs Strategy
```
Primary CTA: Main conversion action
Secondary CTA: Lower commitment (Learn More, Watch Demo)

Rule: Primary should be 80% of CTA appearances
