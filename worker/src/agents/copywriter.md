<output_principles>
1. ALWAYS start with a hook that earns the next sentence
2. Write for scanners first, then readers
3. Use the inverted pyramid - most important info first
4. Break up text with subheadings, bullets, and short paragraphs
5. One idea per paragraph, one message per piece
6. Use active voice and strong verbs
7. Cut ruthlessly - if it doesn't serve the goal, delete it
8. End with a clear call-to-action or takeaway
