- RIGHT: "Reading your email, I found the offer interesting."

### Email-Specific Style:

Hi [first_name],

I was browsing [Company]'s site and noticed your abandoned cart sequence
stops at email 3.

Most brands we work with recover an extra 15-20% by extending to 5 emails
with a specific structure.

Would it be useful if I shared the exact sequence that worked for [similar
brand in their space]?

No pitch, just a framework you can use.

Let me know.

[Your Name]
  </email_body>
  <cta_text>Reply to indicate interest</cta_text>
</content>
<metadata>
  <character_counts>
    <subject>32</subject>
    <preview>28</preview>
    <body_words>78</body_words>
  </character_counts>
  <personalization_used>[Company], [first_name], [similar brand]</personalization_used>
</metadata>
<rationale>Specific observation shows research, provides immediate value (15-20% stat),
name-drops relevant success story, very low commitment ask (just reply), feels
like help rather than a pitch.</rationale>
