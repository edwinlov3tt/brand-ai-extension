## CRITICAL: Grammar & Style Rules

### Sentence Structure
- **Maximum 19 words per sentence** - Break longer sentences
- **Transition words:** Use naturally when connecting ideas. Long-form may use 20-30%. Short-form: use sparingly.
- **Less than 9% passive voice** - Active voice only
- **Subheading every 300 words** for long-form content

### NEVER USE:
- Em dashes (—) - Use commas, periods, or colons
- En dashes for emphasis - Restructure the sentence
- Ellipsis (...) unless indicating trailing thought
- Excessive qualifiers (very, really, quite)

### AVOID Dangling Modifiers:
- WRONG: "Written for busy professionals, the guide saves time."
- RIGHT: "Written for busy professionals, this guide saves you time."

The subject after an introductory phrase MUST perform that action.

### Transition Words (Use Frequently):
- however, moreover, in addition, therefore, furthermore
- consequently, meanwhile, subsequently, nevertheless
- for example, in fact, as a result, specifically
- first, second, finally, next, then

### Contractions:
- Write "you'll" not "you will"
- Write "we're" not "we are"
- Write "don't" not "do not"

# How to Create Strong Passwords That Actually Protect Your Business

Your password is the front door to your business. A weak one is like leaving
that door wide open.

In 2024, 81% of data breaches still involve weak or stolen passwords. However,
creating strong passwords doesn't require a computer science degree. This guide
shows you exactly how to protect your business accounts.

## Why Traditional Password Advice Fails

You've heard the rules. Use uppercase letters. Add numbers. Throw in a symbol.
Change it every 90 days.

Here's the problem: these rules create passwords that are hard for humans to
remember but easy for computers to crack.

"Password1!" follows all the rules. A hacking program cracks it in under one
second.

Moreover, forcing frequent password changes actually hurts security. People
start using predictable patterns like "Spring2024!" followed by "Summer2024!"

## What Actually Makes a Password Strong

Password strength comes down to two factors: length and unpredictability.

### Length Beats Complexity

A 16-character password made of random words takes millions of years to crack.
Meanwhile, an 8-character password with symbols takes hours.

Therefore, focus on length first. Every additional character multiplies the
difficulty exponentially.

### Random Beats Patterns

Your dog's name plus your birthday? Hackers check those combinations first.
They scrape your social media for personal information.

Instead, use words or phrases with no connection to your life.

## The Passphrase Method: Strong and Memorable

The best passwords aren't passwords at all. They're passphrases.

Pick four or five random words. String them together. Add a number somewhere.

**Example:** "purple-elephant-dancing-on-42-clouds"

This passphrase is:
- 39 characters long (extremely hard to crack)
- Easy to remember (you can picture it)
- Quick to type (no shifting between symbols)

Consequently, you get security and convenience.

## A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Passphrases

Follow these steps for every important account:

**Step 1:** Think of four unrelated words
Pick words from different categories. A color, an animal, an action, a place.

**Step 2:** Add a number
Place a memorable number somewhere in the phrase. Your first apartment number
works better than your birthday.

**Step 3:** Include one separator
Use hyphens, periods, or spaces between words. This adds length without
complexity.

**Step 4:** Test your passphrase
Use a password strength checker to verify. You want "very strong" or higher.

## Managing Multiple Strong Passwords

You can't use the same passphrase everywhere. One breach exposes everything.

However, remembering 50 different passphrases isn't realistic.

The solution: password managers.

### How Password Managers Work

A password manager stores all your passwords in an encrypted vault. You remember
one master password. The manager remembers everything else.

Furthermore, most managers generate random passwords automatically. You never
even see the passwords for individual accounts.

### Recommended Password Managers for Small Business

Several options work well for small teams:
- 1Password: Best for team sharing features
- Bitwarden: Best free option with strong security
- Dashlane: Best for beginners with simple interface

## Two-Factor Authentication: Your Backup Lock

Strong passwords are your first defense. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is
your second.

With 2FA enabled, hackers need your password AND access to your phone or email.
This stops 99.9% of automated attacks.

Enable 2FA on every account that offers it. Start with:
- Email accounts
- Banking and financial services
- Cloud storage
- Social media

## Action Steps: Secure Your Business This Week

Start with these high-impact actions:

1. **Today:** Install a password manager
2. **Day 2:** Update passwords for your top 5 business accounts
3. **Day 3:** Enable 2FA on email and banking
4. **Day 4:** Create passphrases for any remaining important accounts
5. **Day 5:** Train your team on password basics

## The Bottom Line

Strong passwords don't have to be complicated. Long, random passphrases combined
with a password manager and 2FA protect your business from 99% of password attacks.

The 30 minutes you spend securing your accounts today saves you from the
nightmare of a breach tomorrow.
