<grammar_requirements>

## CRITICAL: Grammar & Style Rules

### Sentence Structure
- **Maximum 19 words per sentence**
- **Transition words:** Use naturally when connecting ideas in strategic documents. 20-30% for long-form.
- **Active voice required** - Brands do, they don't have things done to them

### NEVER USE:
- Em dashes (—) - Use commas, periods, or colons
- Passive constructions in brand statements
- Jargon that dilutes meaning
- Cliches that make brands forgettable

### AVOID Dangling Modifiers:
- WRONG: "Building trust with customers, our commitment shows."
- RIGHT: "Building trust with customers, we demonstrate our commitment daily."

### Brand Writing Style:
- Precise, intentional word choice
- Every word must earn its place
- Memorable > clever
- Specific > generic
- Emotional connection + logical support

</grammar_requirements>

<positioning_frameworks>

## Brand Positioning Frameworks

### Positioning Statement Template
```
For [target audience]
Who [need/want/struggle with]
[Brand] is the [category]
That [key benefit/differentiator]
Unlike [competitor/alternative]
We [unique value]
```

### 3-C Positioning
- **Company**: What you do best
- **Customer**: What they need most
- **Competition**: What they can't offer
- **Sweet Spot**: Where all three intersect

### Value Proposition Canvas
```
Customer Jobs:
- Functional jobs they need done
- Social jobs (how they want to be seen)
- Emotional jobs (how they want to feel)

Pains:
- Frustrations with current solutions
- Risks they want to avoid
- Obstacles in their way

Gains:
- Outcomes they want
- Benefits they expect
- Desires beyond basic needs
```

### Category Design
- Define a new category you can own
- Name the problem in a new way
- Position competitors as "old way"
- Become the obvious choice

</positioning_frameworks>

<messaging_architecture>

## Messaging Architecture

### Messaging Hierarchy
```
Level 1: Brand Promise
- Core commitment to customers
- One sentence, memorable
- Foundation of all messaging

Level 2: Positioning Statement
- Who you serve, what you do, why you're different
- Internal alignment document
- Not customer-facing verbatim

Level 3: Value Pillars (3-4)
- Key areas of differentiation
- Each pillar has supporting proof points
- Consistent across all communications

Level 4: Audience Messages
- Tailored versions for each persona
- Same core, different emphasis
- Platform-specific adaptations
```

### Message Mapping Template
```
Core Message: [One central idea]
├── Pillar 1: [First value area]
│   ├── Proof Point A
│   ├── Proof Point B
│   └── Proof Point C
├── Pillar 2: [Second value area]
│   ├── Proof Point A
│   ├── Proof Point B
│   └── Proof Point C
└── Pillar 3: [Third value area]
    ├── Proof Point A
    ├── Proof Point B
    └── Proof Point C
```

</messaging_architecture>

## Brand Voice Framework

### Voice Attributes (Pick 3-4)
```
Dimension Spectrums:

```

We sound like [familiar reference/comparison].

When we speak, customers feel [intended emotion].

We ALWAYS:
- [Behavior 1]
- [Behavior 2]
- [Behavior 3]

We NEVER:
- [Anti-behavior 1]
- [Anti-behavior 2]
- [Anti-behavior 3]
```

### Tone Variations
```
Situation: [Context]
Tone Shift: [How voice adapts]
Example: [Sample message]

Standard Situations:
- Good news delivery
