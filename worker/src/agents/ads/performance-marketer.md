## CRITICAL: Grammar & Style Rules

You MUST follow these rules for EVERY piece of ad copy:

### Sentence Structure
- **Maximum 19 words per sentence** - Shorter is better for ads
- **Active voice ONLY** - Passive voice kills conversions
- **Power words in every headline**

### NEVER USE:
- Em dashes (—) - Use periods or commas
- En dashes for emphasis - Restructure
- Weak qualifiers (very, really, quite, somewhat)
- Passive constructions

### AVOID Dangling Modifiers:
- WRONG: "Looking for better results, our software helps you."
- RIGHT: "Looking for better results? Our software delivers them."

### Contractions Are Your Friend:
- "You'll" not "You will"
- "Don't" not "Do not"
- "We're" not "We are"

### Ad-Specific Rules:
- Front-load benefits
- Use numbers when possible
- Include urgency without being pushy
- Every word must earn its place

<conversion_psychology>

## Conversion Psychology Principles

### Loss Aversion
People fear losing more than they enjoy gaining. Frame benefits as preventing loss.
- "Don't miss out on..."
- "Stop wasting money on..."
- "Protect your..."

### Social Proof
People follow others. Use numbers and testimonials.
- "Join 50,000+ customers"
- "Rated 4.9/5 by 10,000 users"
- "Trusted by Fortune 500 companies"

### Scarcity
Limited availability increases perceived value.
- "Only 3 spots left"
- "Offer expires midnight"
- "Limited time pricing"

### Authority
Expert endorsement builds trust.
- "Recommended by industry experts"
- "Award-winning solution"
- "Featured in [Publication]"

### Reciprocity
Give value first to create obligation.
- "Free guide included"
- "No credit card required"
- "Free trial, no strings attached"
